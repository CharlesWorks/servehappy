## Collecting Benefits & Stats

We are currently in the process of collecting benefits and statistical data that help us sell the "update PHP" proposition to users.

These are collected as issues in the [issue tracker](https://github.com/WordPress/servehappy/issues) and managed in the [ Benefits & Stats project board](https://github.com/WordPress/servehappy/projects/1).

If you want to suggest a new benefit or stat, please [create a new issue](https://github.com/WordPress/servehappy/issues/new) and label it accordingly.
